# Week with Shaka

## January 17
- Not a lot of formal coaching sessions. Talked to one group about what the database is and where the data was stored. Debugged the path for their postgres server and then tried to use pictures to explain what's going when they store data in the server. I did a cog app with setting the database up and then left all the tabs open that I used. People still seem pretty confused about what the database is and where data is stored, what postgres is and sql.

I thought this picture was helpful: ![Image of Server/Sql/Client Flow](http://static.commentcamarche.net/en.kioskea.net/pictures/cs-images-3-tier.gif)

Someone wanted to set up authentication and passport on an old to do list project. They asked for a coach before trying so I pointed them to some resources and tried to talk to them through the logic instead of setting it up for them. I'm going to try to encourage people to explicitly ask for a cog app versus just doing things for them.
