# CoachPlay
A journal for all Learners Guild Coaches to share their experiences and knowledge


###Priorities as a coach:
#### 1 Directly coaching learners
- MUST be a pair (or more) <-strict, never coach only one person, have they asked the other team?
- no overtime (don’t spend more than 30 min at a time with a group)

#### 2 Review pull requests
- if none are ready, and you have free time, review others reviews
- useful, actionable, specific feedback. Don't just point out what doesn't work, point out what works. Positivity
- if it’s juicy, too tough, flag SEP (software engineering practicioner)

#### 3 Find common gaps (answering for third time?), share or make resources
- share resources (links) with everyone on echo, write blog post or create resource if a good one doesn’t exist. Cross pollinate knowledge (like bees)

Coaches be reviewing code
>Coaches, if you're not actively helping a team, please be on top of code reviews in prrr. Claim them, review them. Practice reading other people's code and giving useful, actionable, specific feedback. Don't just point out what doesn't work, point out what works. Code style, naming, architecture, tests...etc. Make sure to review the specs.
